# Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset

Project Overview:
In this project, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to terrorist incidents. The goal is to gain insights, discover patterns, and visualize trends within the dataset. Through data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis, we will extract meaningful information from the data and present our findings through visualizations and summary statistics.
